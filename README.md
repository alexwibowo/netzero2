## Setup

### Node version
```
❯ npm -v
8.19.2
❯ node -v
v16.18.1
❯ npm install -g yarn
❯ yarn -v
1.22.19
```

### Initialising project

``` 
yarn create expo-app netZero2
```

When i first created the project, i got an error when trying to start expo web. It turns out i missed a few packages from the default expo creation.

``` 
npx expo install react-native-web@~0.18.9 react-dom@18.1.0 @expo/webpack-config@^0.17.2
```


## Running Project

If you are inside corporate network (e.g. with artifactory proxy), you might need to remove yarn.lock and re-install the project. The re-installation step will download the expo cli.
Without doing this, you might get the following error:
``` 
❯ yarn run web
yarn run v1.22.19
$ expo start --web
Starting project at /Users/wibowoa/dev/hackathon/netZero2
Unable to reach Expo servers. Falling back to using the cached dependency map (bundledNativeModules.json) from the package "expo" installed in your project.

```

So here is the step (while connected to corporate network with npm registry):
``` 
❯ rm yarn.lock
❯ yarn install
yarn install v1.22.19

```
❯ yarn run web
yarn run v1.22.19
